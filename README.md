# Academic Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
## Statistics Research<br>
<br>
1. [Estimating Parameters of a Mixture Model](https://github.com/z-domingo/z-domingo.github.io/blob/master/Est_Model_Params_Math457Midterm.pdf) ([Source Code](https://github.com/z-domingo/z-domingo.github.io/blob/master/est_model_params_src.R))
  - Description: Implemented a Gibbs sampling algorithm using Bayesian methods with given prior information on a given dataset. The goal was to detect the presence of two sub-populations and determine the parameters of the distributions of the sub-populations.<br>

1. [Modeling and Forecasting Crime Patterns in Bellingham, WA](https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1447&context=scholwk)
  - Description: Using data from the local police department, we created and compared a model using Singular Spectrum Analysis and a model using ARIMA to foreast incidence of particular types of crimes. We then compared the effectiveness of each model.<br>
<br>

## Programming Research & Projects<br>
<br>
1. [Protein Resiliencey to the Effects of Drugs](https://github.com/z-domingo/z-domingo.github.io/blob/master/protein_resiliency_project.pdf)
  - Description: Working with a large team in conjunction with graduate research software, our goal was to provide preliminary findings of an exhaustively mutated protein with ligand.<br>

1. [Stocks Investment Strategy Program (Source Code)](https://github.com/z-domingo/z-domingo.github.io/blob/master/stocks_analyzer)
  - Description: this Java program incorporates MySQL statements to retrieve historical stock data from a remote database of a given stock ticker, adjusts prices to reflect stock price splits within a given time frame, and executes an investment strategy based on a 50 day moving average.<br>
<br>

## Essays<br>
<br>
1. [An Exploration and Comparison of Laplace/Fourier Transformations and Cavalieri's Principle](https://github.com/z-domingo/z-domingo.github.io/blob/master/Laplace_Fourier_Trans_and_Cavalieris_Principle.pdf)
  - Description: A short argumentative paper, comparing two mathematical concepts: Cavalieri's Principle and Laplace/Fourier Transformations.<br>
<br>
<br>

# Personal Projects<br>
<br>
1. [Pizza Delivery Data](https://batchgeo.com/map/075584284e2a836d5f5ad77d4dcebe11)(In Progress)
  - Description: Preliminary "heatmap" to see different data points from delivery orders.
